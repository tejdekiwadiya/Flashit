            <h3 class="reveal">Welcome to FlashIt!</h3>
            <div class="reveal">FlashIt Technologies Private Limited, is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet.
                Although generally a User is under no obligation to provide personal information while accessing the
                FlashIt Site, there are some circumstances under which a User may be asked to provide such information
            </div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <div class="reveal">In some circumstances, FlashIt may request personal information from the User, such as
                his or her name, e-mail address, company name, telephone number, etc. Users are free to respond or not
                to respond to these inquiries; all information provided to FlashIt is strictly voluntary. FlashIt is the
                sole owner of information collected by this Site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to
                third parties.
                This Site allows Users to submit their resumes online. Any resume received by FlashIt will be held in
                confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting party for employment. Such
                information is not shared with any third parties or external agencies.
                Some areas of this Site may require Users to provide personal information in order to complete certain
                functions. Such functions may not be available to Users who choose not to provide the information
                requested.
            </div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Registration for Collateral and Software Downloads</h3>
            <div class="reveal">In order to download collateral or trial versions of software provided on the FlashIt
                Site, a User must first fill out a registration form that requests the User’s contact information (such
                as name and email address). This information is used to contact the User about the products and services
                for which he or she has expressed interest.
            </div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Collecting Information for Surveys</h3>
            <div class="reveal">At times FlashIt conducts online surveys to better understand the needs and profiles of
                our Site Users. We will try to the best of our abilities to inform Users of how we will use this
                information at the time of conducting the survey. Survey participation is completely voluntary, and
                Users may refrain from contributing to the survey at any point in time.</div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Use of Log Files</h3>
            <div class="reveal">FlashIt collects User domain information in order to analyze the use of this Site. This
                data enables us to become more familiar with who visits our Site, how often they visit and what parts of
                the Site they visit most often. FlashIt uses this information to improve its Web-based offerings. This
                information is collected automatically and requires no action by the User. By accessing our Site, Users
                grant their unconditional consent to allow FlashIt to collect their domain names.</div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Use of Cookies</h3>
            <div class="reveal">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User’s hard drive that contains information
                about the User. By using a cookie on the FlashIt Site, a User does not have to log into the Site using a
                password more than once. Cookies also enable FlashIt to track and target the interests of our Users in
                order to enhance their experience on our Site. Using a cookie while on the FlashIt Site does not provide
                us with the User’s personal information. Once the User closes his or her browser, the cookie simply
                terminates. If a User rejects the cookie, he or she may still access the FlashIt Site. However, the User
                may experience usage limitations in some areas of the Site.

                For more information about cookies read our Cookie Policy</div>

            <br>
            <h3 class="reveal">Security</h3>
            <div class="reveal">FlashIt takes every precaution to protect a User’s information. When Users submit
                sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline.

                When a FlashIt registration/order form asks Users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card
                number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted using the best encryption software
                in the industry-SSL. While on a secure FlashIt page, the “lock” icon at the bottom of the User’s web
                browser will become locked, as opposed to the unlocked icon that appears when Users are viewing
                unsecured pages.

                In addition to using SSL encryption to protect sensitive User information online, FlashIt also takes
                extensive measures to protect User information offline. All User information (including non-sensitive
                data) is restricted to the FlashIt offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a
                specific task (e.g., billing clerks, customer service representatives, etc.) are granted access to
                Users’ personally identifiable information.

                If you have any questions about the security of the FlashIt Site, please contact us at info@flashit.com

            <h3 class="reveal">Site and Service Updates</h3>
            <div class="reveal">FlashIt reserves the right to distribute Site and service announcements to Users.
                Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information
                about the User’s requested services. FlashIt communicates with Users via email or phone to provide
                requested services and to resolve issues relating to their accounts.

                FlashIt reserves the right to modify or update the privacy statement at any time without notice.</div>
